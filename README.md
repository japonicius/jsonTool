# Sort JSON Alphabetical order

## Getting started
run `./start.sh` to install all dependencies.

## Using it

After installing all dependencies just paste your JSON on `$PROJECT_HOME/resources/input.json`
**save the changes** and run `main`

Sorted JSON by Key Alphabetically will be save on `$PROJECT_HOME/resources/out.json`

I personally open the project on PyCharm view `workspace_sample.png` for details.

Your feedback is most welcome!

Enjoy!
